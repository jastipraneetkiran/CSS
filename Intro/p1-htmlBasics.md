# HTML elements have an opening and closing tag with content in between.

Here is the basic syntax:

```
<openingTag>content</closingTag>
```

The first element you will learn about is the h1 element. The h1 element is a heading element and is used for the main heading of a webpage.
```
<h1>This is a main heading</h1>
```

Change the text of the **h1** element below from **Hello World** to **CatPhotoApp** and watch the change in the browser preview.

When you are done, press the "Check Your Code" button to see if it's correct.
